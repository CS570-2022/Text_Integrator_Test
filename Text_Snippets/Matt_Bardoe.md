- Matthew Bardoe

I like working with students, and of course I like the competitions. At the competitions, I don't really understand 
why I am so emotionally invested in the thrill of it all. I like seeing how many different solutions there are to a 
single problem, and how creative or proficient a team can be. I think that just getting a robot working at all is a 
major accomplishment.
